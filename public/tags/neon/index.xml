      <description>Check out this nighttime cityscape collection of photographic silkscreen prints I made in collaboration with @noealzii. Developing an original printing method that combines both the CMYK &amp;amp; RGB printing processes as well as using ultraviolet inks on black paper allowed for some truly experimental printing that gave us some extremely interesting variants and really brought his work to life!</description>

      <description>For this collaboration I looked into the best method to print the nighttime shot from Noe Alonzo. I decided it would be great to utilise a black paper as it’s a nighttime shot. The next challenge was to figure out the best method to execute the print. For this I used a custom Ultraviolet white ink I had been developing from a recent mural commission along with neon yellow, cyan &amp;amp; magenta.</description>
