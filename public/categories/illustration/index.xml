      <description>Our story begins with Coatlique, the earth goddess, mother to Coyolxanuhqui, goddess of the moon and to her male children, the gods of the stars. While upon Serpent Mountain she finds a ball of feathers and tucks it in her bosom. She looks for it later, but finds it missing. Coatlique realises she is pregnant and begins to tell her children the story of what had happened, but they do not believe her.</description>

      <description>‘Kim Jong Un &amp;amp; Friends’ - This collage piece was originally for a magazine commission I worked on which focused on the human rights issues in North Korea. A human rights commissioner was slandered by the North Korean regime for being gay, this piece play a twist on the story and hopefully sheds some light on the injustices happening within North Korea.</description>
