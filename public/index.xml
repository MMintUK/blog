      <description>Check out this nighttime cityscape collection of photographic silkscreen prints I made in collaboration with @noealzii. Developing an original printing method that combines both the CMYK &amp;amp; RGB printing processes as well as using ultraviolet inks on black paper allowed for some truly experimental printing that gave us some extremely interesting variants and really brought his work to life!</description>

      <description>For this collaboration I looked into the best method to print the nighttime shot from Noe Alonzo. I decided it would be great to utilise a black paper as it’s a nighttime shot. The next challenge was to figure out the best method to execute the print. For this I used a custom Ultraviolet white ink I had been developing from a recent mural commission along with neon yellow, cyan &amp;amp; magenta.</description>

      <description>For this collaboration I looked into the best method to print the daytime shot from Noe Alonzo. As the original photograph predominantly uses magenta &amp;amp; cyan I decided to print half the run without the yellow layer which would amplify the pinks within the image and half with yellow layer to bring out more reds. I added a metalic powder into an additional layer to accentuate the image and add a more unique and magical element to the print which is inline with the initial appeal of the photograph.</description>

      <description>‘Kim Jong Un &amp;amp; Friends’ - This collage piece was originally for a magazine commission I worked on which focused on the human rights issues in North Korea. A human rights commissioner was slandered by the North Korean regime for being gay, this piece play a twist on the story and hopefully sheds some light on the injustices happening within North Korea.</description>
