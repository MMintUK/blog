For this collaboration I looked into the best method to print the daytime shot from Noe Alonzo. As the original photograph predominantly uses magenta & cyan I decided to print half the run without the yellow layer which would amplify the pinks within the image and half with yellow layer to bring out more reds. I added a metalic powder into an additional layer to accentuate the image and add a more unique and magical element to the print which is inline with the initial appeal of the photograph.
